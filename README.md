# About the application and gameplay
This program was made as a study project and is a classic solitaire game where the user interface is replaced by user input actions.

To run the app you need to input __java -jar PL.jar__. After entering your name, a playing field will be generated:

Then you can make a move or just surrender. If you are not one of those who surrender, then the following choice of actions will be available to you:

+ move a card from **free** to **home** stack;
+ move a card from **free** to **base** stack;
+ move a card from **base** to **base** stack;
+ move a card from **free** to **home** stack;
+ move a card from **home** to **base** stack;
+ show a new card from **free** stack.

When you make a choice, you will be prompted to select the next action depending on the chosen. At the end of each action, the playing field will be displayed again
